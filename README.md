# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
 
# About
The app allows users to input a work task from the hours of 9am to 5pm and save the task.  Users will be able to see the time slots in red if that time has already passed and in green if its a future time.
 
# Getting started
Users will begin by adding a task on the appropriate time slot.  Then if they wish to save the task they will press on the save button.  This will maintain the task even if the page is refreshed.
